// If you would like to see some examples of similar code to make an interface interact with an API, 
// check out the coin-server example from a previous COMP 426 semester.
// https://github.com/jdmar3/coinserver

// This function shows and hides the shot selection in the interface based 
// on whether or not the #opponent checkbox is checked
function showHideShots() {
    // Get the info from the checkbox
          let check = document.getElementById('opponent');
    // Check if the checkbox is checked and show or hide options accordingly
        if (check.checked == true) {
    // Here, instead of just showing all of the options, use similar logic to 
    // check which of the game radio buttons is checked and show only those
    // options relevant to the game being selected (rps or rpsls). You can 
    // use similar jQuery 
            $('.shots').show()
        } else {
            $('.shots').hide()
        }
    }
    // This function clears the input form and also resets the shot selection
    // radio buttons.

        document.getElementById('userinput').reset();
        showHideShots();
    }

        // Get which shot is being played based on the value in the form
        let shot = $('input[type=radio][name=shot]:checked').val();

        let baseurl = window.location.href + 'app/'

        console.log(baseurl)
        // This constructs a URL for the opponent option ONLY. To incorporate
        // the other option, you can use a conditional to change the URL based
        // on what is selected. You could also write separate functions, or use
        // a conditional somewhere above in this function to construct the 
        // correct URL
        let url = baseurl + game + '/play/' + shot
        // Log the full URL

        // manipulate another block of HTML in the interface to display the 
        // results in some way.
